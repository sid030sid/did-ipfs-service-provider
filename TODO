increase verifiability by enforcing the file to be signed by the DID holder making the file a verifiable presentation --> this allows for making the file attribute obsolete and replace it with a service endpoint of type linked verifiable presentation: https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/ --> how ever storing the vp in the service endpoint is a violation of the service section as defined by w3c ... maybe leave file attribute after all but change it to "signedFile" indicating that the DID controller has signed the file
discuss moving the public key from verification method to inside authentication array: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#referring-to-verification-methods --> this would make the did not integrateable in key agreements tho!!!
discuss did controller: as of now the did controller only useful to attest the uploader of the ipfs file inside did doc its status of authorship --> usually the did controller is mentioned so that the underlying blockchain of a DID method knows that that did holder is allowed to change the did document
extend the comparative analysis by more aspects that differentiat did:ipfs form other did methods
