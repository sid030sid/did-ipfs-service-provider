# did:ipfs service provider
This repo contains a service provider for did:ipfs operations.

## Set up
1. npm install
2. add cert of your did to folder `cert`
3. add your pinata API key

## Usage
### How to create a did:ipfs?

### How to resolve did:ipfs to its DID Document?

### How to create a did:ipfs with private DID Document?
note: Private DID Documents are only possible when one uses an own IPFS Cluster for storing the DID Documents or one uses Pinata to interact with IPFS (then the Swagger UI's toggle button for private DID doc can be used!)
