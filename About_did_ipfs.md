# did:ipfs
This repo introduces ``did:ipfs``, world's first IPFS based DID method following the official standard for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) provided by W3C. 
In addition, this repo provides a ``did:ipfs service`` which, inter alia, allows anyone to create DIDs. 
In detail, the ``did:ipfs service`` is an API with Swagger UI that can be used to upload files to IPFS that are identifiable with a DID of method: ipfs. 
``did:ipfs`` is a new did method...TODO

##_did:ipfs_ definition
`did:ifps` follows the official standard for DIDs provided by W3C. 
- DID Controller = did of any method
- verification method
- Service endpoints: 
    - Linked Domains
    - Linked Verifiable Presentations --> can be used for personhood credentials (might be essential for use case 3: Data market)
- File = file intended to be uplaoded to IFPS is stored here in a specific format (this is for use case 1: Verifiable Documenting)

## Comparative analysis:_did:ipfs_ vs. other DID methods
Compared to other DID methods, did:ipfs...
1. provides limitless data scalability of its DID Documents
2. enables the inclusion of any data, e.g. pictures, tables etc., in its DID Documents
3. allows its creators to chose between public or private DID Documents
4. stores its DID Documents immutably and permanently (note: data permanency is not guranteed by default. To gurantee data permanency)
5. DID interoperability: controllers of_did:ipfs_ DID Documents can be registered as controller in DID Document using a did from any did method (ipfs, key, cheqd etc.)

Other DIDs:
- [did:ipid](https://did-ipid.github.io/ipid-did-method/)
- did:key
- did:cheqd
- did:ebsi
- did:web
note: we only comapre to DID methods which are complianbt to DIF Universal resolver: https://docs.cheqd.io/product/architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method
note: we only compare to DID methods that are most frequently used
note: this survey on DID methods was condsiderd for the comparative analysis: https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3488/paper05.pdf


## Use cases of did:ipfs
- Verifiable Documenting: recording ownership and/or authorship of IPFS files in a trustworthy and decentralized manner that does not rely on the expensive usage of Blockchains (e.g. NFTs)
- IPFS search: tagging IPFS file based on their content for an IPFS content-based search engine
- Data market: unlocking the untapped data mine of IPFS by transforming it into a data market where data producers and data buyers come together. Data buyers are, for instance, trainers of machine learning models, scientists seeking data for quantative research, or...


## Future work
1. add trustworthy timestamp to each_did:ipfs_ (e. g. with QTSPs)
2. enable the creation of different DID Document versions for each DID (with did:cheqd as role model)
3. add_did:ipfs_ to [DIF's universal resolver](https://dev.uniresolver.io/)

## What is _did:ipfs_?

## What inspired me to create _did:ipfs_?

## What I learned creating _did:ipfs_?

## How I built _did:ipfs_ and the `did:ipfs service provider`?
I developed _did:ipfs_ following W3C's standard for DIDs. I built the `did:ipfs service provider` using [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/) to create an API capable of managing the fundamental _did:ipfs_ operations. The `did:ipfs service provider` allows users to create and resolve _did:ipfs_ identifiers and manage DID Documents. I implemented the functionality to handle data storage using Pinata's File API for managing private DID Documents, ensuring that the solution remains user-friendly and efficient.

## What challenges did I face during creation of _did:ifps_?
Ensuring compliance with W3C's standard for DIDs was crucial for creating _did:ipfs_, particularly when addressing self-referential CIDs in DID Documents.

## What's next for _did:ipfs_?
1. Enhance error handling for the `did:ipfs service provider`.
2. Achieve full compliance of _did:ipfs_ with the W3C DID standard and DIFâ€™s Universal Resolver.
3. Conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis between _did:ipfs_ and other DID methods.
4. Develop _did:ipfs_ services, such as an IPFS search engine and an IPFS-based machine learning data marketplace.
5. Strengthen IPFS data permanence by facilitating connections between file uploaders and storage nodes for exchanging storage proofs to ensure permanence guarantees.
6. Implement trustworthy timestamps within _did:ipfs_ DID Documents, potentially through the integration of Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs).
